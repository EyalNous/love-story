# Assets Folder

Place your image files here:

## Required Files

- `0.jpg` - Cover page image (JPEG format recommended)
- `1.webp` through `52.webp` - Book pages (WebP format for smaller file sizes)

## Optional Files

- `music.mp3` - Background music (will auto-play after first user interaction)

## Image Recommendations

- **Size**: 1080x1920 pixels (9:16 ratio works best for mobile)
- **Format**: 
  - Cover: JPG (good quality, ~500KB)
  - Pages: WebP (best compression, ~200KB each)
- **Optimization**: Use tools like Squoosh.app to compress images

## Quick Setup for Testing

To quickly test the app without real images, the app will show placeholder pages with page numbers. Once you add your actual images, they will replace the placeholders automatically.
